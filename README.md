## 1. Introduction

## 2. Objectives
The general objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that affect housing prices in the United States. Specifically, we want to investigate the following questions:
* Can we predict housing prices based on the features?
* How are housing price and location attributes correlated?
* What is the overall picture of the USA housing prices w.r.t. locations?
* Do house attributes (bedroom, bathroom count) strongly correlate with the price? Are there any hidden patterns?
  
## 3. Preparation

**_3.1 Dataset_** <br>
The USA real estate dataset is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains records on real estate in the United States of America. It provides comprehensive information on the housing properties such as
- status (Housing status - ready for sale or ready to build)
- bed (number of beds)
- bath (number of bathrooms)
- acre_lot (property / land size in acres)
- city (city name)
- state (state name)
- zip_code (postal code of the area)
- house_size (house area/size/living space in square feet)
- prev_sold_date (previously sold date)
- price (housing price, it is either the current listing price or recently sold price if the house is sold recently)

**_3.2 Acessibility & Sourcing_** <br>
Ahmed Shahriar Sakid published the USA real estate dataset on Kaggle, collecting data from [Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/research/data). Therefore, anyone utilizing this data in research, analysis, or other projects should attribute it to Realtor.comÂ® Economic Research. If the data is used on digital properties like Github, it is recommended to include a link to their data library.

## 4. Processing
**_4.1 Importing Data and Data Cleaning** <br>
The dataset containing the 1 CSV file was imported into Microsoft SQL Server. The raw data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis using the aforementioned server.  This process may include several tasks such as joining tables, __aggregating data, and creating new variables based on the existing ones._

**4.2 _Initial Analysis_** <br>
SQL queries were utilized to extract initial insights from the data, with the aim of gaining a preliminary understanding of the real estate pricing. This involved analyzing data patterns and trends, such as identifying the price range for properties in different neighborhoods, types of properties that were in high demand, and factors that influenced the pricing.

**_5.1 Connecting Microsoft Power BI to a Microsoft SQL Server Database_** <br>
Importing data from the SQL database was established to Power BI to enable the creation of interactive visualizations and reports.

## Draft

The data preparation phase began by importing the housing data, an Excel file, into a SQL database. Several steps were conducted to ensure the suitability of the data for further processing and analysis. The process started by searching for duplicates and subsequently eliminated in a newly created table while preserving the original dataset as a backup. Removing unnecessary columns were also executed. In addressing the data constraints problem aside from the duplicates, the accuracy of the data type was also verified and ensured the data fell within the appropriate range. Now, we proceeded into looking for text and categorical data problems like inconsistent categories and formatting, length violation for text data and failure to adhere to proper naming conventions.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This may involve tasks such as joining tables, aggregating data, handling missing values, and creating new calculated fields.__
